Splitter Backup System of Doom
(c) 2006 Michael D. Labriola <mdlabriola@yahoo.com>

The Splitter Backup System is designed to prepare TAR archives to be burned to
DVD media.  Currently, the maximum file size of an ISO9660 file system is
exactly 2G (2^31 bytes).  Splitter will traverse it's provided list of file
system nodes, creating TAR files no bigger than this limit.  Then you can
simply collect however many of these TAR files fit on your media (DVDs are
around 4.5G and DVD-dl are around 8.2G) into an ISO file using 'mkisofs' and
burn away.

Splitter is written in Python, so it should be relatively easy to port
to other *nix systems.

Requires:
  Python >= 2.3
